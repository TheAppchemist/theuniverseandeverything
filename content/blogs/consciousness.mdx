What is consciousness? That is both a difficult and subjective question to answer. Which is one of the reasons I've been putting this topic off for almost a year.

It's quite scary when you speak about such topics; most commonly because these are the topics you are most likely not going to agree with the majority of the audience. However, I have come to believe that that is the beauty about it. It's not about right or wrong. If right and wrong were the case then I don't think we would truly be conscious.

My belief on consciousness requires the analysis of the lowest form of consciousness (negative infinity) and the highest form (positive infinity). The easiest way I can attempt to dissect this with our finite minds is by comparing one of the least animated objects in this world, with one of the most (overly) animated `objects` in the world. A comparison between a rock and a human being. The latter obviously falls on the higher spectrum of consciousness.

Consciousness is a matter of observing and experiencing the world, through any means possible. Everything goes, and all is permitted.  With lower consciousness, those possibilities are very limited. A rock stays in place unless moved. Its experiences are dependent on external forces rather than itself. It gets moved. However, it doesn't mean that the rock does not experience.

Moving on to the latter; we are the highest form of consciousness that we know of (humans). Godlike consciousness is something that we still have to agree on. Some believe it can be found within ourselves, however others believe we need to look outward. This is beyond us (at least me) and beyond the scope of this text.

What we perceive as life, is a journey of moving from least animated to Godlike animated, because naturally - the spirit is a highly curious being.

Obviously, the cycle has stages. I don't know the stages - however, knowing the process puts us at a good start. The process can be explained by analyzing how we consume our food. We need to realize that food plays a very vital role in our wellbeing - and keeps us connected to this world. When we stop eating, we break the agreement of being part of this world. Which is why, abstaining from food is practiced by many religions to bring one's self closer to spirit and further from the flesh.

Let's look at the lowest form of consciousness as mentioned above, the rock (earth). It cannot move. It can contain life that wants to experience. So earth gives birth to vegetation which changes its landscape with shapes and vibrant colors - also somewhat animating slowly to the external environment. 

This new life has its unique expressions. Some are greedy and want to use all resources available, some are reserved and will only use as needed. Some are poisonous, and want to hurt and some are freely giving and want to give more life. These expressions are limitless just as higher conscious beings would have.

At this time, vegetation is still forcefully connected to earth. Vegetation realized its limitation, and we have animals that eat the vegetation. This allows the vegetation to live through the animals by unrooting (pun intended) itself from its earthly tether. Vegetation is able to give life to herbivores.

We need to remember, it's extremely hard to extract nutrients from the earth; hence plants use the majority of their energy into extracting that rather than experience. And herbivores will consume the already processed nutrients and spend more time to `experience`.

This is life looking for ways it can experience. The process will continue for carnivores who are able to eat less than herbivores because they receive more processed nutrients from the meat. Until it gets to us.

Life finds a way to transport nutrients (energy) efficiently to allow an entity to `experience` more. 
 
Simply put, consciousness is the ability of an entity to observe the universe and experience it as efficiently as possible. Without observation and experience, the universe cannot exist... it shouldn't.
